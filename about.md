# About
This site is my platform to **share with you the knowledge I've gained** through my professional, academic, and personal life. I'm not exactly sure what I'll write about yet, but I plan on writing about the following topics:

- Frontend development with React.js
- Backend Development with Laravel
- Command Line and Linux
- Design

###### More about me
My coding journey began when I started a music blog with WordPress back in high school. I had specific ideas for the design and was severely limited by my knowledge of HTML and CSS. This led to me teaching myself how to make basic websites.

I eventually abandoned the music blog, but a love for creating websites stuck with me. Fast forward a couple years later and now I'm a computer science major at the University of Missouri&mdash;Saint Louis and part time web developer for FitnessRepairParts.com.
