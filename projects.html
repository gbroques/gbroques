		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>The following three projects are websites that are representative of my <b>web design</b>, <b>html</b>, and <b>css</b> skills. Each one of them was meticulously hand-crafted and built to be mobile optimized. They're all inspired by real companies. Be sure to resize the window for each one to see how they respond to different device sizes.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> These days I'm no longer building websites, but instead focus on creating software and web applications. Stay tuned for work that is more representative of what I do now.</p>
		<p>Also be sure to checkout <a href="/coursework">school projects</a> I've written in <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b>, and other various langauges.</p>

		<h5>Variety Vending</h5>
		<p>A single page website for a small vending machine business. The design is a giant vending machine that plays on the naturally long rectangular shape of web pages. Almost all the details were implemented with pure css and svg.</p>

		<p>A landing page for a small jewelry business. The design takes inspiration from flat design trends and features a place for business owners to introduce themselves through video.</p>

		<h5>K Rock Productions</h5>
		<p>A landing page for a small music production studio. The design features a bright red to purple gradient to give the page life. I had a lot of fun designing the little svg music icons for this one.</p>
